# Combine001

Odoo 19 custom app implementing the "Odoo ERP Enhancements v1.0" BRD
(Sibyl Technologies, for Combine Spinning, 2026-09-16).

## Layout

- `combine001/` — the Odoo module (installable, `application: True`). All
  configuration, security groups, views and menus load automatically when
  the module is installed — no manual setup steps required.

## What it implements

| BRD Section | Feature | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | Sales Order price-change approval workflow + audit trail | `models/sale_order.py` |
| 5.1.2 / 5.2 | Quotation qty ceiling, item-wise & customer-wise qty limits | `models/sale_order.py`, `models/product_template.py`, `models/customer_item_limit.py` |
| 5.3 | Cumulative delivery quantity validation | `models/stock_move.py` |
| 5.4 | Cumulative invoice quantity validation | `models/account_move.py` |
| 5.5 | Sales Tax Template | native Odoo `account.tax` — no custom code needed |
| 5.6 | Additional charges (freight/transport/handling/service) | `models/charge_type.py`, `wizard/add_charge_wizard.py` |
| 5.7 | Commission Agent + automatic commission calc on invoice | `models/commission_agent.py`, `models/commission_line.py`, `models/account_move.py` |
| 5.8 | Chart of Accounts restructuring + real opening trial balance import | `models/res_company.py`, data in `data/import/` |
| 7 | Separate Tax Ledger + controlled manual adjustment | `views/tax_ledger_views.xml`, `models/tax_adjustment.py` |
| 10 | Security groups (Tax Officer, Auditor) + audit trail via chatter | `security/combine001_security.xml` |
| 3.1 | One demo user per defined role, pre-assigned to the right groups | `data/combine001_users_data.xml` |
| — | "Quotation" relabeled to "Sales Contract" across the Sales app | `views/sale_quotation_to_contract_views.xml` |
| — | Finished Goods / Raw Material product catalog import | `models/res_company.py`, data in `data/import/` |
| — | GST 18%/22% Sale+Purchase taxes, defaulting to 18% | `models/res_company.py`, `models/account_tax.py` |
| — | "GST Saved" — notional GST tracking when no GST is charged | `models/gst_saving.py`, `models/account_move.py`, `views/gst_saving_views.xml` |

## Products, Categories & Chart of Accounts mapping

`models/res_company.py`'s `_combine001_run_import()` (the same method that
imports the Chart of Accounts — see below) also imports the product
catalog from `D:\Others\Combine Spinning\Finished Goods and RM.xlsx`. Runs
every time regardless of whether the opening balance is posted (like
Customers/Vendors — product master data isn't part of the historical
trial balance, so there's no reason to freeze it at go-live).

**The source file is a daily stock/production report, not a product
list or price list** — two sheets ("Finished Goods", "Raw Material"),
each a snapshot of opening/production/dispatch/closing quantities by
material family, re-grouped inconsistently across the sheet (the same
category name reappears several times, e.g. "MIX MATERIAL YARN" 3
times). `data/import/product_categories.csv` and `products.csv` are the
*cleaned* output of studying and parsing that report (see the category
mapping table below) — not re-parsed from the workbook at install time.

**What got created:**
- **18 product categories** in 2 families — *Finished Goods* (11
  yarn-material categories + Socks/Cloth/Towel) and *Raw Material* (6
  fiber-type categories) — each with `property_valuation = 'periodic'`
  (matches how this company's existing Chart of Accounts already works:
  "Raw Material Consumed" as a direct expense, "Stock in Trade" as a
  plain asset, no interim/GRNI accounts anywhere — this is a periodic/
  manual-valuation books, not Odoo's automated perpetual model, so
  `periodic` was the correct choice, not `real_time`).
- **284 products** (172 Finished Goods + 117 Raw Material minus 5 exact
  name collisions across categories in the source report — kept the
  first occurrence of each, see the comment in the CSV generation), all
  `type='consu', is_storable=True`, UoM **KG** (the only unit that's
  actually consistent across the source data — "Bags"/"Cones"/"Bales"
  each convert to a different KG weight per product, so KG was the only
  safe uniform choice).
- Every category's Income/Expense(COGS)/Stock accounts are mapped onto
  the **already-imported real Chart of Accounts** wherever a specific
  match existed (e.g. Raw Material > Cotton → `5.01.01.0002 RAW MATERIAL
  CONSUMED - COTTON` / `3.08.03.0001 RAW MATERIAL STOCK COTTON`, Raw
  Material sales → the existing `4.01.01.0002 LOCAL SALES - RAW
  MATERIAL`, all Yarn categories → the existing `4.01.01.0001 LOCAL
  SALES - YARN`). Where no matching account existed yet, a small,
  clearly-new one was added in an unused code slot next to its natural
  siblings (Finished Goods had no Stock/COGS accounts at all yet, Socks
  had no Income account, Lycra had no Consumption account despite
  already having a Stock account) — see `_STRUCTURAL_ACCOUNTS` in
  `models/res_company.py` for the full list and reasoning, and the GST
  section below for the other 2 new accounts.
- **No prices.** The source report has zero pricing data (it's a
  quantity report) — products import at price 0, for Sales/Finance to
  fill in.
- **No opening stock quantities.** The report's quantity columns are a
  point-in-time snapshot mixed with monthly production/dispatch deltas,
  not something safe to import as "current stock" without risking a
  materially wrong inventory count — only product *master data* is
  created here. Loading real opening stock quantities (with a costing
  method and a proper opening inventory adjustment) is a separate,
  follow-on piece of work if wanted.

## GST 18%/22% and "GST Saved"

Four `account.tax` records (`models/res_company.py`
`_combine001_ensure_gst_taxes`, tagged `x_combine001_gst=True` via
`models/account_tax.py` so the GST-Saved logic below can recognize
them): **GST 18% (Sale)**, **GST 22% (Sale)**, **GST 18% (Purchase)**,
**GST 22% (Purchase)** — posting to the Chart of Accounts' existing
`3.11.05.0002 SALES TAX PAYABLE - OUTPUT` / `3.11.05.0001 SALES TAX
REFUNDABLE - INPUT` accounts respectively. **18% is the default** for
both directions (company + every imported product) since the source
data doesn't say which specific items need 22% — flip those manually
once known (product's Sales/Purchase tab, or Accounting > Taxes).

**Sale-side rate now follows the buyer's GST registration status**
(follow-up request): FBR charges a higher rate on supplies to
unregistered buyers, so a Sales Contract/Order line or a Sales Invoice
line no longer just takes whatever GST tax is configured on the
product — `models/account_tax.py`'s `_combine001_swap_gst_for_buyer`
swaps in **18% if the customer's Tax Info tab says Registered, 22% if
Unregistered** (the field's own default), overriding
`sale.order.line._compute_tax_ids` and
`account.move.line._compute_tax_ids` (`models/sale_order.py` /
`models/account_move.py`) on top of Odoo's normal product-tax default,
so it also live-recomputes if the customer on an existing
order/invoice is changed. Purchase-side GST (what a vendor charges us)
is untouched — "buyer" here always means our own customer. Existing
records aren't retroactively rewritten, only new/recomputed lines.

**"GST Saved":** whenever a customer invoice or vendor bill (or credit
note/refund) is **posted with no GST charged at all**,
`models/account_move.py`'s `_combine001_create_gst_saving_line` computes
what GST *would* have applied — for each line, using whichever of the 4
GST taxes is configured on that line's product master (`taxes_id` for
sales, `supplier_taxes_id` for purchases; a line whose product has no
GST tax configured contributes nothing, there's no rate to fall back on)
— and records the total as a same-amount entry:

```
Dr  3.13.01.0001  GST Saving            (Current Asset)
Cr  1.09.01.0001  GST Saving Reserve    (Equity)
```

posted immediately (own journal entry, Miscellaneous Operations
journal), linked back to the source invoice/bill via a
`combine001.gst.saving.line` record — *Combine001 > Taxation > GST
Saved*, **invoice/bill-wise**: list view grouped by Sale/Purchase then
Customer/Vendor (drop the grouping, or add "Invoice/Bill", to see every
individual entry), each row showing the source invoice/bill and
partner directly, with a running total; the form view (click a row) has
"Open Invoice/Bill" and "Open GST Saving Entry" buttons; the pivot view
can drill Sale/Purchase → Customer/Vendor → Invoice/Bill by month. This
is **deliberately kept out of the real P&L** (it never touches an
income/expense account) — a pure memo/management metric of the value of
off-GST-books trade, not a real tax liability or saving.

**Where it shows on the Balance Sheet** (*Accounting > Reporting >
Balance Sheet*, verified against a real posted entry):
- `GST Saving` → **ASSETS > Current Assets** (verified: `9,000.00`
  appeared there for a test entry)
- `GST Saving Reserve` → **EQUITY (& EARNINGS) > Equity**, as the
  **last line** in that section — sorting after Retained Earnings /
  Profit Distribution (groups `1.03`/`1.05`), which is what "below
  Profit/(Loss) for the period" could reasonably ask for from the CoA
  side. One honest caveat: Odoo's own Balance Sheet renders "Equity"
  (static accounts, incl. this one) as a section that comes *before* its
  own separate, computed "Earnings" section (Current Year Unallocated
  Earnings = the live Profit/(Loss) figure) — so in the rendered report
  specifically, GST Saving Reserve sits just *above* that Earnings
  section, not literally under the number itself. It's still the very
  last, clearly separated line before it, which is as close as the
  report's own fixed structure allows.

**Seeing the impact with vs. without GST Saving:** rather than hacking a
checkbox into Odoo's Enterprise financial-report engine (a real,
version-fragile undertaking for a niche need), the *GST Saved* report
gives a direct running total, and because both accounts are isolated in
their own dedicated groups (`3.13`, `1.09`) with no sibling accounts,
the standard Balance Sheet's own line-folding already lets you
collapse/expand exactly these two lines to see the delta directly — the
simpler, safer answer to "give me an easy way to see the impact."

## "Quotation" → "Sales Contract"

Combine Spinning's trade calls these documents "contracts", not
"quotations" — `views/sale_quotation_to_contract_views.xml` relabels the
term across the core Sales app: the main menu (*Sales > Orders > Sales
Contracts*), list/search view titles, search filters ("My Sales
Contracts"), the "Set to Sales Contract" button, the "Mark Sales Contract
as Sent" action, the CRM Team "New Sales Contract" button, the generated
PDF filename (`Sales Contract - S00001.pdf` instead of
`Quotation - S00001.pdf`), and the PDF report body itself (title "Sales
Contract #", "Contract Date" label). **Purely cosmetic** — the underlying
`sale.order` model, its fields, states (`draft`/`sent`/`sale`), and the
whole quotation→order workflow are completely unchanged; only the text a
user sees is different.

Not renamed: the Print-menu action's own technical label (still shows
"PDF Quote" — that's set by the Enterprise `sale_pdf_quote_builder`
module, which happens to load after combine001 and silently wins that one
field; not worth forcing a fight over a rarely-seen label via a fake
dependency), and anything outside the core Sales app (Subscriptions, POS,
Website/eCommerce, email template wording) — out of scope per the chosen
rename scope.

## Contract → Sales Order → Delivery Out → Delivery Challan → Gate Pass → Sales Invoice

Implements `BRD for sales.docx`. A "Contract" is exactly what the section
above calls a Sales Contract — a `sale.order` in `draft`/`sent` state; a
"Sales Order" is the same record once confirmed (`state == 'sale'`). No
separate Contract model was introduced — the BRD's own title describes
the change as mapping this flow onto "the existing quotation-to-delivery
process", and Odoo's native Quotation→Order transition already *is* that
first step.

**Price lock.** Once a Contract is confirmed, `sale.order.line.write()`
(`models/sale_order.py`) blocks any `price_unit`/`product_uom_qty` change
outright (`UserError`, points the user at a Contract Amendment instead).
The same lock is mirrored on draft invoice lines linked to a Contract
line (`models/account_move.py`, `AccountMoveLine.write()`) — posted
invoices are correctly left alone; a posted invoice is fixed with a
credit note, not silently rewritten.

**Contract Amendment** (`models/sale_amendment.py`,
`combine001.sale.amendment` + `.line`) is the only door through that
lock: draft → submit → Sales Manager approval → Apply. Applying writes
straight onto the *same* existing `sale.order.line` record (never
creates a second line for a line being revised — a genuinely new product
can also be added through the same amendment), re-baselines
`x_quoted_price`/`x_quoted_qty` so the pre-existing "can't exceed the
quotation" guard (BRD SO-005/SO-006, unrelated feature) keeps working
against the new number afterward, pushes the revised price onto any
still-draft invoice lines already raised against that line, and chatter-
logs every apply with user/date/old→new values.

**Delivery Out** (`models/delivery_out.py`, `combine001.delivery.out` +
`.line`) is a new, plain (non-stock) document created from a confirmed
Sales Order via the "Create Delivery Out" button. Its lines are
`related(..., store=True)` back onto the originating `sale.order.line` —
price/qty changes from a later Contract Amendment reach it automatically,
with no propagation code and no possibility of a duplicate line, since
there is exactly one Delivery Out line per Sales Order line.

**Delivery Challan** is the *existing* `stock.picking`/Delivery Note
functionality, technically untouched (still the only document that
deducts stock, still only on validation) and cosmetically relabeled
"Delivery Challan" — same technique as the Quotation rename, plus a
`stock.picking.type._get_code_report_name()` override so the PDF title
follows too, and a one-time idempotent rename of each warehouse's
outgoing `stock.picking.type.name` (real per-company data, done in
`res_company._combine001_rename_delivery_picking_types`, not a fixed XML
id). Gained fields: `x_delivery_out_id` (set when raised from a Delivery
Out), the 3 registration-status fields, and `x_contract_price` on each
`stock.move` (`related='sale_line_id.price_unit'`).

**Gate Pass** (`models/gate_pass.py`, `combine001.gate.pass` + `.line`)
is created from a *validated* (`state == 'done'`) outgoing Delivery
Challan via a button on the picking form. One per Delivery Challan
(DB unique constraint on `picking_id`) — no stock impact, lines mirror
the challan's own `stock.move`s via `related` fields.

**Tax Info tab** (`models/res_partner.py`, `views/res_partner_views.xml`)
replaces the BRD's flat Registered/Unregistered checkbox pair with a
separate status per tax regime — GST, Income Tax, PRA — since this
business actually tracks all three independently. All 3 flow onto every
document above via `models/combine001_tax_status_mixin.py`
(`combine001.tax.status.mixin`, an `AbstractModel` with 3
`related(..., store=True)` Selection fields against `partner_id`, mixed
into `sale.order`, `stock.picking` and `account.move`; Delivery Out/Gate
Pass declare the same 3 fields directly since their `partner_id` is
itself `related`). PRA status is deliberately the odd one out: it's
hidden on a document (`x_show_pra_status`, computed per model from that
document's own lines) unless at least one line's product has the new
`product.template.x_pra_applicable` flag set (Sales tab) — most of this
business is goods (GST), not services (PRA).

**Commission Report payment tracking** (`models/commission_line.py`):
`payment_state` (Unpaid/Paid), `payment_id`/`payment_reference`/
`payment_date`, and computed `amount_outstanding`/`amount_paid` (BRD
sec. 13.3's explicit ask). Marked Paid either per-record
(`action_mark_paid`) or in bulk from the Commission Report list's Action
menu (`combine001.commission.payment.wizard`).

## Withholding tax automation on Payments

Follow-up request on top of the BRD. `combine001.withholding.rate`
(`models/withholding_rate.py`) is one row per Vendor/Customer + date
range: a standard `rate`, and an optional exemption for that period with
its own `exempt_rate` (can be 0% for a full exemption) — rates can
therefore change over time and a partner's exemption certificate expires
back to the standard rate automatically, purely by date. "purchase" =
the rate WE withhold paying that Vendor; "sale" = the rate THAT CUSTOMER
is expected to withhold paying us (tracked from our own side, since we
don't see their books).

**Accounting mechanism.** `account.payment` gains `x_wht_applicable`,
`x_wht_rate`, `x_wht_amount` (computed) and `x_wht_account_id`
(`models/account_payment.py`). Rather than hand-building extra journal
lines, this overrides Odoo core's own `_prepare_move_withholding_lines`
— a documented no-op stub that exists in core `account` specifically for
this ("payment net of tax withheld"): the framework already reduces the
liquidity (bank) line by the withholding amount while the counterpart
(payable/receivable) line still clears the FULL invoice amount, so the
override only needs to return the withholding line itself, sign flipped
by direction (credit the Withholding Payable liability, purchase side /
debit the Withholding Receivable asset, sale side). Verified by
literally reading the posted `account.move.line`s: paying a PKR 1,180
GST-bearing bill at 10% correctly posts Dr Payable 1,180 / Cr Bank 1,062
/ Cr Withholding Tax Payable 118 — the bank line, not the payable, absorbs
the withholding.

**CoA accounts** (`models/combine001_constants.py`): purchase-side reuses
an **existing** leaf account from the real imported CoA — `2.12.01.0001
TAX AT SOURCE - PARTIES`, sitting in the CoA's own `2.12 TAX AT SOURCE`
liability group, an exact match for "tax withheld from party payments,
not yet remitted". Sale-side has no existing leaf, only a matching empty
group (`3.11.03 ADVANCE INCOME TAX AGAINST LOCAL SUPPLIES`) — one new
leaf account (`3.11.03.0001`, same name, asset) is created there, same
`_STRUCTURAL_ACCOUNTS` mechanism as the GST Saving accounts.

**Purchase-side "applicable by default".** A bare `account.payment` has
no reliable way to know which bill it's settling until it's actually
reconciled. The normal path — clicking **Register Payment** on a posted
bill — does know, so `account.payment.register._create_payment_vals_from_wizard`
is overridden to set `x_wht_applicable = True` by default exactly when
the bill being paid actually carries one of this module's GST taxes
(`account.move._combine001_has_gst_charged`), and to default `x_wht_rate`/
`x_wht_account_id` from the rate table for that vendor/date either way.
A manually-created payment (no invoice context) instead falls back to a
plain `partner_id`/`payment_type`/`date` onchange that defaults the rate/
account but leaves `x_wht_applicable` for the user to tick.

**Withholding Tax Variance report** (Combine001 > Taxation): BRD ask —
"see if customer deducted more or less than the amount that must have
been deducted". Every inbound (customer) payment also computes
`x_wht_expected_rate`/`x_wht_expected_amount` fresh from the rate table
for its own date, independent of whatever was actually entered, plus
`x_wht_variance = actual - expected`; the report is simply
`account.payment` filtered to customer payments with a "Variance Only"
search filter, list + pivot.

**Known pre-existing gap this depends on** (documented above under Chart
of Accounts, not new here): since the generic CoA auto-install is
deliberately cancelled, `res.company.transfer_account_id` and each
partner's `property_account_receivable_id`/`property_account_payable_id`
are never auto-seeded, and Odoo needs at least one of those to register
*any* payment at all (withholding or not). A human sets these once from
Accounting > Configuration before payments (with or without withholding)
can be used — same category of "left for a human to wire before go-live"
gap as the bank-journal defaults already noted above.

Verified: fresh install + 2 upgrade cycles clean, and a full functional
test (24 assertions) covering CoA account reuse/creation, the rate
table's overlap constraint, purchase-side auto-default from a real
GST-bearing bill through the actual Register Payment wizard with the
resulting journal entry checked line-by-line, sale-side expected-vs-
actual variance math (including an intentionally over-withheld case),
an exemption period resolving to its reduced rate then correctly
expiring back to no-rate, and the variance report's own domain — all
passing.

## Roles & demo users (BRD Section 3.1)

Every BRD role gets its own **Combine001-branded security group**
(`security/combine001_security.xml`), organized into 6 privileges (rows) —
Sales, Warehouse, Accounting, Tax, Audit, Administration — all under one
"Combine001" category, so the whole access matrix is manageable from a
single block on *Settings > Users & Companies > Users > (user) > Access
Rights*, instead of being scattered across native Sales/Inventory/
Accounting/Settings sections. Being separate privileges (rows) means a
user can hold a selection from **each** at once (e.g. Sales Manager +
Finance Manager simultaneously) — they aren't mutually exclusive.

Each of these wraps (via `implied_ids`) the real native Odoo group(s) that
grant the actual functional access, so assigning the Combine001-branded
role is enough on its own for a real (UI-assigned) user — no need to also
manually tick the underlying native group:

| Privilege | Role | Wraps |
|---|---|---|
| Sales | Sales User | `sales_team.group_sale_salesman` |
| Sales | Sales Manager | + `sales_team.group_sale_manager` |
| Warehouse | Warehouse User | `stock.group_stock_user` |
| Accounting | Accountant | `account.group_account_user` |
| Accounting | Finance Manager | + `account.group_account_manager` |
| Tax | Tax Officer | `account.group_account_user` |
| Audit | Auditor | — (Combine001-only read access, see below) |
| Administration | **Module Admin** *(new)* | full CRUD on Combine001's own models (quantity limits, charge types, commission agents, tax ledger adjustments) — no access to the rest of Odoo |
| Administration | System Administrator | Module Admin + `base.group_system` |

One demo user per role is created on install, already in the right
group(s):

| Role | Login |
|---|---|
| Sales User | `sales.user@combine001.local` |
| Sales Manager | `sales.manager@combine001.local` |
| Warehouse / Inventory User | `warehouse.user@combine001.local` |
| Accountant | `accountant@combine001.local` |
| Finance Manager / Controller | `finance.manager@combine001.local` |
| Tax Officer | `tax.officer@combine001.local` |
| Module Admin | `module.admin@combine001.local` |
| System Administrator | `system.admin@combine001.local` |
| Auditor | `auditor@combine001.local` (read-only on Sales Orders, Invoices,
  Payments, Deliveries and every Combine001 model — see `views/audit_views.xml`) |

**No password is set** — these are placeholder accounts committed to a
public git repo, and a hardcoded password there would be a credential
leak. After install, a System Administrator sets each one's password
locally via *Settings > Users & Companies > Users > (user) > Action >
Change Password*, or triggers *Send Password Reset Instructions* if
outgoing mail is configured. They're meant as a starting point for
setup/UAT — rename, reassign, or deactivate them and create real named
accounts once the client's staff list is confirmed.

Each demo user's `group_ids` still lists the full closure of groups
explicitly (both the Combine001-branded role group *and* the native
group(s) it wraps) rather than relying on `implied_ids` to cascade
automatically: testing on this Odoo 19 build showed `implied_ids` does
not propagate to a user created via a plain `(6, 0, [...])` write on
`group_ids` in XML data (it works fine for a real user assigned a role
through the Users UI — only XML-created users need this workaround) —
see the comment in `data/combine001_users_data.xml`.

## Chart of Accounts, opening trial balance, Customers & Vendors, bank accounts

`models/res_company.py`'s `_combine001_run_import()` replaces the company's
Chart of Accounts and opening trial balance with the client's actual data
— extracted from `D:\Others\Combine Spinning\coa and opening trial.xlsx`
(Chart of Accounts sheet, a Delta ERP trial balance with levels, as on
15-Sep-2026) and `D:\Others\Combine Spinning\Customers and Vendors.xlsx`.
The cleaned data it imports from is bundled at `data/import/*.csv`
(generated once from those two workbooks, not re-read from them at
install/upgrade time).

**Runs on install AND on every module upgrade** — wired via a
non-`noupdate` `<function>` tag (`data/combine001_import_run.xml`), not
`post_init_hook`: `post_init_hook` only ever fires on a fresh install,
never on `-u`/Upgrade, which is why the data didn't show up after the
first deploy on a database where the module was already installed before
this feature existed. The whole thing is written to be safe to re-run
on every future upgrade too:

- Accounts, account groups, bank journals and Customers/Vendors are all
  **found-or-created by their natural key** (code / name) instead of
  blindly recreated, so re-running never produces duplicates.
- Until the opening balance is posted (see below), every run does a
  **full, clean rebuild**: any pre-existing journal entries for the
  company are cleared first (see step 1) so accounts/groups/opening
  balances always come out correct and consistent — no partial/stale
  leftovers, no "only some of it shows up."
- Opening balances are (re)computed via Odoo's native
  `opening_debit`/`opening_credit` fields — the same mechanism Odoo's own
  CSV-import UI uses — every time the pre-posted rebuild runs, right after
  the reset in step 1 clears whatever the previous run's lines were, so
  there's never a stale line for Odoo's own auto-balancing mechanism to
  collide with. (Setting these fields doesn't build the move
  synchronously — it queues a precommit callback — so the import forces
  an `env.cr.flush()` before posting, otherwise `account_opening_move_id`
  reads back empty.)
- Once the opening move has actually been **posted** (i.e. the business
  has gone live on this data), a later upgrade **skips the Chart of
  Accounts / opening balance / currency part entirely** rather than
  resetting and rewriting live financial data — logged as a warning.
  Customers, Vendors and bank journals still refresh normally either way.

**What it does, step by step:**

1. Unless the opening move is already posted (skip straight to step 6 if
   so — see above): **clears every existing journal entry** for the
   company, posted or draft (unposts first if needed). This is what
   actually fixes "only 2 lines show in the Trial Balance" and "still in
   USD" — both were caused by leftover entries from *before* this import
   ever completed correctly (e.g. Odoo's own fallback CoA auto-install,
   step 3, completing before this module's fix was in place, or ad hoc
   testing) sitting there blocking things: Odoo's Trial Balance/General
   Ledger/Balance Sheet only show *posted* entries by default, so with
   the real 1,007-account opening balance stuck in draft, only those
   stray entries were visible; and Odoo flatly refuses to change company
   currency while *any* `account.move.line` exists at all (posted or
   draft) — including this import's own opening balance from a prior run,
   which is why the currency fix kept silently failing after the very
   first attempt.
2. Sets the company currency to **PKR**, now that step 1 has cleared
   anything that would block it (activates the PKR currency record if
   needed). Also force-updates anything else that stores its **own**
   currency independently instead of following the company automatically
   — a default `product.pricelist` in particular is auto-created by
   `product`/`sale_management` using whatever the company's currency
   happened to be at that exact moment, which can be stale (still USD
   from before this module ever ran, even after the company itself is
   correctly PKR) — and any `account.journal` with a stray non-PKR
   currency override gets cleared back to "follow company currency".
3. Cancels Odoo's own fallback "auto-install a generic Chart of Accounts"
   behaviour, which would otherwise create a *second*, competing default
   CoA and journals for any company with no localization chosen (see the
   big comment on `_combine001_cancel_generic_coa_auto_install` — this was
   the one genuinely surprising Odoo 19 internal to work around).
4. Creates a `Miscellaneous Operations` (general), `Customer Invoices`
   (sale) and `Vendor Bills` (purchase) journal if the company doesn't
   already have one of each — needed for day-to-day invoicing and for the
   opening move itself.
5. Imports **126 account groups** (Level 1–3 of the source CoA) and
   **1,007 accounts** (Level 4 posting accounts) with their opening
   balances, then **posts the opening move** — real opening balances (a
   ~21.4 billion Rs trial balance) would ideally be reviewed by a Finance
   Manager before posting, but it's posted automatically here so the data
   actually shows up in every standard report; any residual rounding is
   auto-balanced by Odoo against the equity "Undistributed Profits"
   account. Once posted, it's protected from every future rebuild (see
   above) — a correction after that point should be a proper reviewed
   accounting adjustment, not another module upgrade silently rewriting
   it.
6. **Debtors/Creditors control accounts (BRD COA-001/002/003):** instead
   of importing the source's 331 individual vendor-named and 33
   individual customer-named GL leaf accounts, this creates one **control
   account** per named sub-group instead (e.g. "CREDITORS-RAW MATERIAL",
   "DEBTORS - EXPORT"), each carrying that sub-group's own rolled-up
   opening balance from the source trial balance — mathematically
   identical to the sum of the individual accounts it replaces (verified:
   the two differ by Rs 1 out of ~21.4 billion, pure floating-point
   rounding in the source spreadsheet). Customer/vendor-level detail is
   tracked the Odoo-native way instead: via `partner_id` on the journal
   item (Partner Ledger), not a separate GL account per party. Any
   pre-existing account whose code is not part of this import gets
   archived (not deleted — other configs may reference it).
7. **Bank/cash accounts and journals:** every one of the ~30 real, named
   accounts under "CASH AND BANK BALANCE" is imported as its own GL
   account (like any other posting account, step 5) *and* gets its own
   `account.journal` (type `bank` or `cash`, per whether its code is under
   `3.14.01.*` "Cash in Hand"), linked via `default_account_id`. The one
   with the single largest opening debit balance is marked as the default
   (lowest `sequence`, so it's the one every journal/payment picker shows
   first) — currently "MEEZAN BANK 0204-0100906298".
8. Imports the **341 customers** and **346 vendors** from the Customers
   and Vendors workbook as `res.partner` Contacts (`customer_rank`/
   `supplier_rank` set), each with `property_account_receivable_id` /
   `property_account_payable_id` pointing at the correct control account
   — determined from that party's *original* code prefix in the source
   workbook (e.g. a vendor coded under `2.07.01.xxxx` gets the
   "CREDITORS-RAW MATERIAL" control account), even though the new account
   codes themselves ignore those old numbers, per the ask. A party whose
   original group has no named control account (most customers — see
   below) falls back to one general control account each: `3.09.01`
   "TRADE DEBTORS - LOCAL SALES (GENERAL)" for customers, the existing
   `2.07.09` "CREDITORS - OTHERS" for vendors. Runs every time regardless
   of whether the opening move is posted, so party master data always
   stays current.

**Note on data completeness:** the source CoA workbook explicitly excludes
"dormant" accounts (both Debit and Credit closing balance in {0, 1, 2} Rs)
from the *balance* extract — see its Notes sheet. Most customers (308 of
341) fall under debtor sub-groups that got excluded this way (their
balances had fully netted out by the snapshot date), which is why they
route to the one general control account above rather than a named
sub-group; only 15 of 346 vendors are in the equivalent situation. This
does **not** mean those parties are missing — the Customers and Vendors
workbook is unfiltered, so all of them are imported as Contacts either
way; only the not-currently-meaningful GL sub-group distinction is
collapsed for them.

**Not done automatically, by design** (would require guessing at real
business specifics this data doesn't contain): rewiring the *other*
company-level default-account settings (cash-difference accounts,
early-payment-discount accounts, product category default income/expense
accounts, tax repartition line accounts, fiscal positions) that a prior
chart-of-accounts template may have set to now-archived accounts, and
deciding whether the auto-picked default bank journal (largest opening
balance) is actually the one that should be used going forward. Review

## Assumptions made for the BRD's open items (Section 12)

The BRD explicitly leaves six points open for client sign-off. This module
ships a working default for each so the app is usable end-to-end now;
change these in code once the client confirms:

1. **Quantity hierarchy precedence** — all applicable limits (quotation
   qty, item limit, customer+item limit) are enforced independently; the
   most restrictive one blocks first.
2. **Price-override approval** — flat rule: *any* price change away from
   the quoted price on a draft/sent order routes to a Sales Manager.
3. **Invoicing policy** — order-based: invoice quantity is validated
   against the Sales Order quantity (not delivered quantity).
4. **Commission base** — configurable per Commission Agent / Sales Order
   (`sales_value` / `product_value` / `quantity` / `net_sales_value`);
   defaults to Sales Value. `product_value` and `net_sales_value` are
   currently computed the same as `sales_value` (invoice line subtotal).
5. **Customer accounting dimension** — uses Odoo's native `partner_id` on
   journal items (Partner Ledger / Aged Receivable reports already give
   customer-wise detail); no new dimension model was added.
6. **Tax Ledger adjustment approval** — single level: Finance Manager
   approves. Approval only marks the request Approved — it does not
   auto-post a journal entry, since the actual GL accounts to use are
   part of the still-open Chart of Accounts restructuring (COA-003); the
   Accountant posts the entry manually referencing the approved record.

## Install / Upgrade

Addon lives under `~/odoo/custom/` (symlinked as `combine001` ->
`combine001_odoo/combine001`) on the WSL Odoo dev instance, addons path
already includes `~/odoo/custom`. Fresh install:

```
odoo-bin -c <conf> -d <db> -i combine001 --stop-after-init
```

Upgrade an already-installed database to pick up code/data changes
(including a re-run of the CoA/opening-balance/Customers&Vendors import,
per the safety rules described above):

```
odoo-bin -c <conf> -d <db> -u combine001 --stop-after-init
```

On Odoo.sh or any web-based install, the equivalent is: push to the
tracked branch, then in that database's backend go to **Apps**, clear the
"Apps" filter, search **Combine001**, and click **Upgrade** (not just
confirm it's installed — Upgrade is what re-runs the import).
