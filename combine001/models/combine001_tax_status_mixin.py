    """Registered/Unregistered status, mirrored from the Customer/Vendor
    master (res.partner's Tax Info tab) onto every document the BRD
    requires it on: Contract/Sales Order, Delivery Out, Delivery Challan,
    Gate Pass and Sales Invoice (BRD sec. 4.3). Each inheriting model
    must already have its own `partner_id` field - this only adds the 3
    related, stored status fields so they're queryable/filterable on the
    document itself instead of always joining back to the partner.

    PRA status is deliberately NOT part of this mixin's automatic
    display: whether to show it on a given document depends on that
    document's own lines (only when a PRA-applicable product is on it -
    see product_template.x_pra_applicable), which differs per model, so
    each inheriting model defines its own `x_show_pra_status` compute.
